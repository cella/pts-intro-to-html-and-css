						# Intro to HTML/CSS
						## Class 1

						---

						### Welcome to Philly Tech Sistas!
						[TODO, notes about code of conduct, intro slides]

						---

						### Introduce yourself
						Let’s get to know each other a little better.
						- What’s your name? 
						- What do you hope to get out of this class?
						- What is your favorite or dream vacation destination?

						---

						### By the end of this class...
						You will have created your portfolio website!

						---

						### What is HTML?
						HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language

						HTML is what we use to make websites. It tells web browsers how to display content (like text, images, links, and videos) on a webpage. 
						
						---

						### The history of HTML
						Tim Berners-Lee originally invented “hypertext” to share scientific papers.
						- 1991 - First web page August 6, 1991
						- 1994 - w3 Consortium formed (their goal is to standardize the web)
						- 1997 - HTML 4
						- 2000 - XHTML
						- 2014 - HTML 5

						---

						![alt text](img/client-server-model.png "Illustration of the client server model")
						How does the web actually work?

						---

						## Getting started
						
						<!-- .slide: class="style-section" -->

						---

						### Tools to get you started
						1. Text editor
						1. Browser
						1. Developer tools

						---

						### 1. Text editor
						A program that lets you enter and edit plain text. It can also be referred to as a “code editor”. Some examples are [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), [Atom](https://atom.io), and [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com).

						---
						
						We’ll be using Sublime Text in this class! 

						You can download it [here.](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

						![alt text](img/sublime-text-screenshot.jpg "Screenshot of the Sublime Text 2 text editor.")

						---

						### 2. Browser
						Software for accessing webpages. The browser “talks” to a server and “asks” it for the webpage and content that you are trying to access.

						![alt text](img/browser-logos.png "Logos of popular browsers.")

						---

						### 3. Developer Tools
						All modern browsers give developers a toolkit to interact with the content on a page. You can do things like inspect loaded HTML, CSS and even see how long it took images to load.

						![alt text](img/developer-tools.png "Chrome Developer Tools.")

						--- 

						## Demo
						Let’s take a look at [Philly Tech Sistas](https://www.phillytechsistas.org) under the hood.

						We can go to our browser and right-click anywhere. Selecting the “Inspect option from the dropdown list to see some code!

						![alt text](img/pts-right-click.png "Screenshot of right-click on Philly Tech Sistas.")

						---

						### Exercise: Let’s start our project!
						We’ll start by creating a folder that will house all of your files. Anything that will appear on your site will go in this folder, including HTML files, CSS files, and images.
						
						<!-- .slide: class="style-exercise" -->

						--
						
						File names should not include spaces or special characters. They are also case sensitive. <!-- .element: class="small" -->

						![alt text](img/site-files.png "An HTML site folder shown to contain an images folder, index.html and styles.css files.")

						---
						
						## Structure of an HTML page

						<!-- .slide: class="style-section" -->

						---

						### Doctype
						The first thing on an HTML page is the doctype, which tells the browser which version of the markup language the page is using.

						``` html
						<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">
						```

						``` html
						<!DOCTYPE html>
						```

						This is _not_ case sensitive. You could write DOCTYPE, doctype or doCTypE. <!-- .element: class="small" -->
						
						---

						### Head
						Contains the page title and meta information about the page. Meta information is invisible to the user, but has many purposes, like providing information to search engines.

						---
						
						### Body
						Contains the content of the page. Everything in the body is visible to the user.

						---

						### Example
						``` html
						<!DOCTYPE html>
							<html>
							  	<head>
							    	<title>Title of the page</title>
							  	</head>
							  	<body>
							    	The page content here.
								</body>
						</html>
						```

						---

						### Nesting
						All elements “nest” inside one another. Nesting occurs when elements are inside other containing tags. 

						For example, you would put the <p>inside of the <body> tags. The <p> is now nested inside the <body>

						``` html
						<body>
							<p>A paragraph inside the body tag</p>
						</body>
						```

						---

						### Exercise: Let’s set up our HTML
						Open up your new project in SublimeText and we’ll make our first web page!

						![alt text](img/empty-sublime.png "Sublime Text editor open to a blank page")
						
						<!-- .slide: class="style-exercise" -->

						---
						
						## HTML tags

						<!-- .slide: class="style-section" -->

						---

						### Anatomy of a tag

						#### Opening and closing tags
						Content must be contained within the opening tag and the closing tag.

						``` html
						<p>This is some content.</p>
						```

						#### Self-closing tags
						Some elements don’t need to contain content! Images and break elements are examples of this.
						
						``` html
						<img src="image.jpg" alt="Your image">
						```

						``` html
						<br>
						```

						---

						### Attributes
						Attributes give more information about your element. Some are required for the element to work, such as the `src="img.jpg"` on the `<img>` tag. Some are optional.

						![alt text](img/html-attributes.jpg "Screenshot highlighting attributes.")

						---

						### Values
						Values allow us to make changes to our HTML attributes.

						![alt text](img/html-values.png "Screenshot highlighting values in an image element.")

						---
						
						## Elements

						<!-- .slide: class="style-section" -->

						---

						### Headings
						Heading number indicates hierarchy, not size. Think of outlines from high school papers.

						``` html
						<h1>Written</h1> 
						<h2>In</h2> 
						<h3>Decreasing</h3>
						<h4>Order</h4>
						<h5>Of</h5>
						<h6>Importance</h6>
						```

						---

						### Paragraphs
						The browser doesn’t care about line breaks in your code, unless you contain your content in different paragraph tags.

						``` html
						<p>Cum sociis natoque  penatibus et magnis dis  parturient montes, nascet ridiculus mus.</p>
						```

						---

						### Horizontal rule
						This element represents a thematic break between paragraphs. You may use it to indicate that you are changing the subject within a section, for example.

						``` html
						<hr>
						```

						![alt text](img/html-horizontal-rule.png "Screenshot highlighting a horizontal rule")

						---

						### Exercise: Let’s add some content!
						Introduce yourself on your website!

						If you don’t know what to write, put in some [fun placeholder text!](https://loremipsum.io/ultimate-list-of-lorem-ipsum-generators/)

						![alt text](img/example-site-screenshot.png)
						
						<!-- .slide: class="style-exercise" -->

						---

						### Link types
						Links have attributes that different actions like open in a new tab, or launch your e-mail program.

						1. Relative links
						1. Absolute links
						1. Anchor links

						---

						#### 1. Relative links
						The file path is relative to the `index.html` page’s location. 

						``` html
						<a href="page.html">Link to a local page.</a>
						```

						---

						#### 2. Absolute links
						The file path has to include the full url (most commonly used for external site links).

						``` html
						<a href="http://google.com">Link to an external page.</a>
						```

						---

						#### 3. Anchor links
						You can tell the browser to go to a section on the page.

						``` html
						<a href="#projects">Link to a section on the page.</a>
						```

						---

						### Link attributes
						You can also add other attributes to links to complete different actions, like open in a new tab or launch an email program.

						``` html
						<a href="website.html" target="_blank">Opens in another tab.</a>
						```

						``` html
						<a href="mailto:email@youremail.com">E-mail us!</a>
						```

						---

						### Lists
						Lists can be ordered or unordered. Unordered lists show up as generic bullet points, while ordered get numbers. You can change the style of both using CSS.

						1. Ordered lists
						2. Unordered lists

						---

						#### 1. Ordered list

						``` html
						<ol> 		
							<li>Order</li> 		
							<li>Matters</li>
							<li>Here</li>
						</ol>
						```
						
						**Output**
						1. Order
						2. Matters
						3. Here

						---

						#### 2. Unordered list

						``` html
						<ul> 		
							<li>Order</li> 		
							<li>Doesn’t</li>
							<li>Matter</li>
						</ul>
						```
						
						**Output**
						- Order
						- Doesn’t
						- Matter

						---

						### Exercise: Let’s add some content!
						Let’s add an anchor navigation to our website together. Don’t worry about where the links will go to for now. Add the following"
						1. About
						1. Projects

						``` html
						<header>
							<nav>
								<ul>
									<li>
										<a href="#about">About</a>
									</li>
									<li>
										<a href="#projects">About</a>
									</li>
								</ul>
							</nav>
						</header>
						```

						![alt text](img/example-site-screenshot.png)
						
						<!-- .slide: class="style-exercise" -->

						---

						### Image 
						The image tag has two required attributes: `src` and `alt`. You can use a relative link or link to any image on the internet with an absolute link.

						``` html
						<img src="image.jpg" height="300px" width="200px">
						```

						``` html
						<img src="https://www.website.com/image.jpg" height="300px" width="200px">
						```

						---

						### Exercise: Let’s add some content!
						Add your headshot to your website.

						If you didn’t bring a headshot to class, don’t worry—you can use [this website](https://placekitten.com/) to generate one! <!-- .element: class="small" -->

						![alt text](img/example-site-screenshot.png)
						
						<!-- .slide: class="style-exercise" -->

						---

						### Divider
						The `<div>` tag is a _block-level_ division or section in an HTML document. It can contain anything, but has no meaning.

						``` html
						<div>
							<p>Some content.</p>
						</div>
						```

						---

						### Span
						The `<span>` tag is an _inline_ division in an HTML document. It can contain anything, but also has no meaning.

						``` html
						<p><span>Some</span> content.</p>
						```

						---

						### Exercise: Let’s add some content!
						We’re going to set up some placeholder projects. Start by adding 4 `<div>`’s to your website.

						![alt text](img/example-site-screenshot.png)
						
						<!-- .slide: class="style-exercise" -->

						---

						### Comments
						Annotations that can act as notes, commentary or explanations within your code. They show up in the browser, but don’t do anything.

						``` html
						<!-- HTML Comment! -->
						```

						``` html
						<!-- <ul> 		
							<li>Order</li> 		
							<li>Doesn’t</li>
							<li>Matter</li>
						</ul> -->
						```

						---

						### Tables
						Tables are a way to represent complex information in a grid format. They are made up of rows and columns.

						![alt text](img/html-basic-table.jpg)

						---

						#### Table code 


						``` html
						<table>
							<caption>Title of your table</caption>
							<tr>
								<th>Column header</th>
								<th>Column header</th>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Data</td>
								<td>Data</td>
							</tr>
						</table>
						```

						---

						### Exercise: Let’s add some content!
						We’re going to add a table that contains some skills that you have, and your comfort level in that skill from 1-5.

						![alt text](img/example-site-screenshot.png)
						
						<!-- .slide: class="style-exercise" -->

						---

						## Break!
						
						<!-- .slide: class="style-break" -->

						---

						### What is CSS?
						- Cascading Style Sheets
						- CSS describes how HTML elements are to be styled
						- Examples of how CSS is used: [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com)

						---

						### How to include CSS
						- Inline
						- Internal stylesheet
						- External stylesheet

						---

						### Inline
						- The inline style is added as an HTML attribute
						- Good for an individual CSS change that you do not use repeatedly throughout the site
						- This is _not_ a recommended approach

						``` html
						<h1 style="font-size: 48px;">My headline</h1>
						```

						---

						### Internal
						- An internal stylesheet holds the CSS code for the webpage in the head section of the particular file
						- Only affects the page the code is inserted into
						- Not reuseable

						``` html
						<head>
							<style>
								body { background-color: blue; }
								p { color: white; }
							</style>
						</head>
						```

						---

						### External
						- An external stylesheet is a standalone .css file that is linked from a web page.
						- It can be created once and shared on multiple web pages
						- Saves time and effort
						- Easy to maintain
						- Preferred approach

						``` html
						<head>
							<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
						</head>
						```

						---

						### Exercise
						- Create a new CSS file called `style.css` inside your css folder
						- Link to your css file inside your `index.html` file using the external stylesheet approach
						
						<!-- .slide: class="style-exercise" -->

						---

						## CSS syntax

						<!-- .slide: class="style-section" -->

						---

						### CSS syntax
						- **Selector:** points to the HTML element you want to style
						- **Declaration:** includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon
						- **Declaration group:** is surrounded by curly brackets
						- **Property:** indicates which stylistic features (e.g. font, width, background color) you want to change
						- **Values:** Each property is given a value, which indicates how you want to change those stylistic features
						
						TODO: image with anatomy

						---

						### Selector
						- Element selector
						- Id selector
						- Class selector
						- Grouping selectors

						---

						### Element Selector
						- The element selector selects elements based on the element name.
						- The code below selects all `<p>` elements on a page and makes it center aligned and red

						``` css
						p {
							text-align: center;
							color: red;
						}
						```

						---

						### Id Selector
						- The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element
						- The id of an element should be unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one element
						- Use a hash (#) followed by the id of the element

						``` css
						#slideshow {
							background: green;
							border: 1px solid red;
						}
						```

						---

						### Class Selector
						- The class selector selects elements with a specific class attribute
						- Use a period (.) character, followed by the name of the class

						``` css
						.center {
							text-align: center;
						}
						```

						---

						### Grouping selectors
						If you want to have multiple elements with the same styles you can group the selectors like this:

						``` css
						h1, h2, p {
							text-align: center;
							color: red;
						}
						```

						---

						### Descendent selector
						- Descendent selectors (or descendent combinator) allow you to combine two or more selectors so you can be more specific 
						- Elements matched by the second selector are selected if they have an ancestor element matching the first selector.

						``` css
						ul li {
							margin: 10px;
						}
						```

						---

						### Cascading
						Styles “cascade” down until changed

						``` css
						p {
							color: red;
							font-weight: bold;
							font-size: 18px;
						}

						.blue {
							color: blue;
						}
						```

						``` html
						<p>I’m red, bold, and italic.</p>
						<p class="blue">I’m all of those things, and also blue!</p>
						```

						---

						### Cascading priority
						1. Important!—most important
						1. Inline CSS
						1. ID
						1. Class
						1. Element—least important

						``` css
						.better {
							background-color: gray;
							border: none!important;
						}

						p {
							background-color: blue;
							color: white;
							padding: 5px;
						}
						```

						---

						### Specificity
						If two CSS selectors apply to the same element, the one with higher priority wins.
