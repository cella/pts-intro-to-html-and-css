						# Intro to HTML/CSS
						## Class 1

						---

						### Welcome to Philly Tech Sistas!
						[TODO, notes about code of conduct, intro slides]

						---

						### Introduce yourself
						Let’s get to know each other a little better.
						- What’s your name?
						- What do you hope to get out of this class?
						- What is your favorite or dream vacation destination?

						---

						### By the end of this class...
						You will have created your portfolio website!
						![alt text](img/example-site-screenshot.png "Screenshot of example site")

						---

						### What is HTML?
						HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language

						HTML is what we use to make websites. It tells web browsers how to display content (like text, images, links, and videos) on a webpage.

						---

						### The history of HTML
						Tim Berners-Lee originally invented “hypertext” to share scientific papers.
						- 1991 - First web page August 6, 1991
						- 1994 - w3 Consortium formed (their goal is to standardize the web)
						- 1997 - HTML 4
						- 2000 - XHTML
						- 2014 - HTML 5

						---

						![alt text](img/client-server-model.png "Illustration of the client server model")
						How does the web actually work?

						---

						## Getting started

						<!-- .slide: class="style-section" -->

						---

						### Tools to get you started
						1. Text editor
						1. Browser
						1. Developer tools

						---

						### 1. Text editor
						A program that lets you enter and edit plain text. It can also be referred to as a “code editor”. Some examples are [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), [Atom](https://atom.io), and [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com).

						---

						We’ll be using Sublime Text in this class!

						You can download it [here.](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

						![alt text](img/sublime-text-screenshot.jpg "Screenshot of the Sublime Text 2 text editor.")

						---

						### 2. Browser
						Software for accessing webpages. The browser “talks” to a server and “asks” it for the webpage and content that you are trying to access.

						![alt text](img/browser-logos.png "Logos of popular browsers.")

						The instructions for this class were written for Chrome, but any browser will work similarly.

						---

						### 3. Developer Tools
						All modern browsers give developers a toolkit to interact with the content on a page. You can do things like inspect loaded HTML, CSS and even see how long it took images to load.

						![alt text](img/developer-tools.png "Chrome Developer Tools.")

						---

						## Demo
						Let’s take a look at [Philly Tech Sistas](https://www.phillytechsistas.org) under the hood.

						We can go to our browser and right-click anywhere. Selecting the “Inspect option from the dropdown list to see some code!

						![alt text](img/pts-right-click.png "Screenshot of right-click on Philly Tech Sistas.")

						---

						### Exercise: Let’s start our project!
						We’ll start by creating a folder that will house all of your files. Anything that will appear on your site will go in this folder, including HTML files, CSS files, and images.

						<!-- .slide: class="style-exercise" -->

						--

						File names should not include spaces or special characters. They are also case sensitive. <!-- .element: class="small" -->

						![alt text](img/site-files.png "An HTML site folder shown to contain an images folder, index.html and styles.css files.")

						---

						## Structure of an HTML page

						<!-- .slide: class="style-section" -->

						---

						### Doctype
						The first thing on an HTML page is the doctype, which tells the browser which version of the markup language the page is using.

						``` html
						<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">
						```

						``` html
						<!DOCTYPE html>
						```

						This is _not_ case sensitive. You could write DOCTYPE, doctype or doCTypE. <!-- .element: class="small" -->

						---

						### Head
						Contains the page title and meta information about the page. Meta information is mostly invisible to the user, but has many purposes, like providing information to search engines.

						---

						### Body
						Holds the visible content of the page. This is where you put anything you wish the user to see.

						---

						### Example
						``` html
						<!DOCTYPE html>
						<html>
							<head>
								<title>Title of the page</title>
							</head>
							<body>
								The page content here.
							</body>
						</html>
						```

						---

						### Nesting
						HTML is structured by nesting elements inside other elements. This is done by placing elements inside other containing tags.

						For example, you would put the `<p>`inside of the `<body>` tags. The `<p>` is now nested inside the `<body and is a "child" or a "descendent" of the body.

						``` html
						<body>
							<p>A paragraph inside the body tag</p>
						</body>
						```

						---

						### Exercise: Let’s set up our HTML
						Open up your new project in SublimeText and we’ll make our first web page!

						1. Add the document type
						1. Add an html element
						1. Nest a head and body element next to each other, inside the html

						![alt text](img/empty-sublime.png "Sublime Text editor open to a blank page")

						<!-- .slide: class="style-exercise" -->

						---

						## HTML tags

						<!-- .slide: class="style-section" -->

						---

						### Anatomy of a tag

						#### Opening and closing tags
						Content must be contained within the opening tag and the closing tag. Note the `/` in the closing tag!

						``` html
						<p>This is some content.</p>
						```

						#### Self-closing tags
						Some elements don’t need to contain content! Images and break elements are examples of this.

						``` html
						<img src="image.jpg" alt="Your image">
						```

						``` html
						<br>
						```

						---

						### Attributes
						Attributes give more information about your element. Some are required for the element to work, such as the `src` and `alt` on the `<img>` tag. Some are optional.

						![alt text](img/html-attributes.jpg "Screenshot highlighting attributes.")

						---

						### Values
						Values allow us to make changes to our HTML attributes.

						![alt text](img/html-values.png "Screenshot highlighting values in an image element.")

						---

						## Elements

						<!-- .slide: class="style-section" -->

						---

						### Headings
						Heading number indicates hierarchy, not size. Think of outlines from high school papers.

						``` html
						<h1>Written</h1> 
						<h2>In</h2> 
						<h3>Decreasing</h3>
						<h4>Order</h4>
						<h5>Of</h5>
						<h6>Importance</h6>
						```

						---

						### Paragraphs
						The browser doesn’t care about line breaks or tabs in your code, and they will be ignored. Use a `<p>` tag to split lines of text in the displayed page.

						These examples will render the same:

						``` html
						<p>Cum sociis natoque penatibus</p>

						<p>
							Cum
							sociis
							natoque penatibus
						</p>
						```

						---

						### Horizontal rule
						This element represents a thematic break between paragraphs. You may use it to indicate that you are changing the subject within a section, for example.

						``` html
						<hr>
						```

						![alt text](img/html-horizontal-rule.png "Screenshot highlighting a horizontal rule")

						---

						### Exercise: Let’s add some content!
						Introduce yourself on your website!

						If you don’t know what to write, put in some [fun placeholder text!](https://loremipsum.io/ultimate-list-of-lorem-ipsum-generators/)

						![alt text](img/example-site-screenshot.png)

						<!-- .slide: class="style-exercise" -->

						---

						### Link types
						Links can take users to another page, another web site, or a specific part of a page.

						1. Relative links
						1. Absolute links
						1. Anchor links

						---

						#### 1. Relative links
						The file path is relative to the `index.html` page’s location.

						``` html
						<a href="page.html">Link to a local page.</a>
						```

						---

						#### 2. Absolute links
						The file path has to include the full url (most commonly used for external site links).

						``` html
						<a href="http://google.com">Link to an external page.</a>
						```

						---

						#### 3. Anchor links
						You can tell the browser to go to a section on the page.

						``` html
						<a href="#projects">Link to a section on the page.</a>
						```

						---

						### Link attributes
						With some adjustments, links can open in a new tab or perform a special action, like opening the user's default mail application.

						``` html
						<a href="website.html" target="_blank">Opens in another tab.</a>
						```

						``` html
						<a href="mailto:email@youremail.com">E-mail us!</a>
						```

						---

						### Lists
						Lists can be ordered or unordered. Unordered lists show up as generic bullet points, while ordered get numbers. You can change the style of both using CSS.

						1. Ordered lists
						2. Unordered lists

						---

						#### 1. Ordered list

						``` html
						<ol> 
							<li>Order</li> 
							<li>Matters</li>
							<li>Here</li>
						</ol>
						```

						**Output**
						1. Order
						2. Matters
						3. Here

						---

						#### 2. Unordered list

						``` html
						<ul> 
							<li>Order</li> 
							<li>Doesn’t</li>
							<li>Matter</li>
						</ul>
						```

						**Output**
						- Order
						- Doesn’t
						- Matter

						---

						### Exercise: Let’s add some content!
						Let’s add an anchor navigation to our website together. Don’t worry about where the links will go to for now. Add the following"
						1. About
						1. Projects

						``` html
						<header>
							<nav>
								<ul>
									<li>
										<a href="#about">About</a>
									</li>
									<li>
										<a href="#projects">About</a>
									</li>
								</ul>
							</nav>
						</header>
						```

						![alt text](img/example-site-screenshot.png)

						<!-- .slide: class="style-exercise" -->

						---

						### Header and nav elements
						You probably noticed the new elements we used for this exercise. The `header` element is meant to contain information relevant to the content below it, and the `nav` element should contain ways for the user to navigate. You can have multiples of these on a page.

						---

						### Image
						The image tag has two required attributes: `src` and `alt`. You can use a relative link or link to any image on the internet with an absolute link.

						``` html
						<img src="image.jpg" height="300px" width="200px">
						```

						``` html
						<img src="https://www.website.com/image.jpg" height="300px" width="200px">
						```

						---

						### Exercise: Let’s add some content!
						Add your headshot to your website.

						If you didn’t bring a headshot to class, don’t worry—you can use [this website](https://placekitten.com/) to generate one! <!-- .element: class="small" -->

						![alt text](img/example-site-screenshot.png)

						<!-- .slide: class="style-exercise" -->

						---

						### Block vs. Inline Elements
						So far, we've seen some elements that will appear on their own line in the page, and some that can appear next to other elements. Those are called "block-level" and "inline" elements, respectively.

						- **Block:** headings, paragraphs, lists
						- **Inline:** links, images

						---

						### Choosing which element to use
						Each element has two main aspects that make it different from another element.

						1. How a browser will display it by default. Developers can manipulate this with styles.
						2. What browsers and search engines will assume about the content of that element. This is called the "semantic" value of an element.

						---

						### Semantics
						Search engines and screen-readers understand that the content of a heading is meant to be more important than the content of a paragraph, and they will expect to find something useful in a nav element. They will treat links differently from images, which are different from text. Choosing the right element matters.

						---

						### Divider
						The `<div>` tag is a _block-level_ division or section in an HTML document. It can contain anything, but has no semantic value.

						``` html
						<div>
							<p>Some content.</p>
						</div>
						```

						---

						### Span
						The `<span>` tag is an _inline_ division in an HTML document. It can contain any non-block content, but also has no semantic value.

						``` html
						<p><span>Some</span> content.</p>
						```

						---

						### Non-semantic elements
						`div` and `span` are called non-semantic elements. They don't add any information for non-human readers. But they're great when you only need to add styles!

						---

						### Exercise: Let’s add some content!
						We’re going to set up some placeholder projects. Start by adding 4 `<div>`’s to your website.

						![alt text](img/example-site-screenshot.png)

						<!-- .slide: class="style-exercise" -->

						---

						### Comments
						Annotations that can act as notes, commentary or explanations within your code. They show up in the browser, but don’t do anything.

						``` html
						<!-- HTML Comment! -->
						```

						``` html
						<!-- <ul> 
							<li>Order</li> 
							<li>Doesn’t</li>
							<li>Matter</li>
						</ul> -->
						```

						---

						### Tables
						Tables are a way to represent complex information in a grid format. They are made up of rows and columns.

						![alt text](img/html-basic-table.jpg)

						---

						#### Table code


						``` html
						<table>
							<caption>Title of your table</caption>
							<tr>
								<th>Column header</th>
								<th>Column header</th>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Data</td>
								<td>Data</td>
							</tr>
						</table>
						```

						---

						### Exercise: Let’s add some content!
						We’re going to add a table that contains some skills that you have, and your comfort level in that skill from 1-5.

						![alt text](img/example-site-screenshot.png)

						<!-- .slide: class="style-exercise" -->

						---

						### Other elements of interest
						We've covered the basics to get you started, but there are many more elements available, some of which are very semantically useful:

						- section
						- article
						- footer
						- em
						- strong

						Check out a [complete list](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) for more info.

						---

						## Break!

						<!-- .slide: class="style-break" -->

						---

						### What is CSS?
						- Cascading Style Sheets
						- CSS describes how HTML elements are to be styled
						- Examples of how CSS is used: [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com)

						---

						### How to include CSS
						- Inline
						- Internal stylesheet
						- External stylesheet

						---

						### Inline
						- The inline style is added as an HTML attribute
						- Good for an individual CSS change that you do not use repeatedly throughout the site
						- This is _not_ a recommended approach

						``` html
						<h1 style="font-size: 48px;">My headline</h1>
						```

						---

						### Internal
						- An internal stylesheet holds the CSS code for the webpage in the head section of the particular file
						- Only affects the page the code is inserted into
						- Not reuseable

						``` html
						<head>
							<style>
								body { background-color: blue; }
								p { color: white; }
							</style>
						</head>
						```

						---

						### External
						- An external stylesheet is a standalone .css file that is linked from a web page
						- It can be created once and shared on multiple web pages
						- Saves time and effort
						- Easy to maintain
						- Preferred approach

						``` html
						<head>
							<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
						</head>
						```

						---

						### Exercise
						- Create a new CSS file called `style.css` inside your css folder
						- Link to your css file inside your `index.html` file using the external stylesheet approach

						<!-- .slide: class="style-exercise" -->

						---

						## CSS syntax

						<!-- .slide: class="style-section" -->

						---

						### CSS syntax
						- **Selector:** points to the HTML elements you want to style
						- **Property:** indicates which stylistic features (e.g. font, width, background color) you want to change
						- **Values:** Each property is given a value, which indicates how you want to change those stylistic features
						- **Declaration:** includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon
						- **Declaration group:** is surrounded by curly brackets

						---

						### CSS syntax
						![alt text](img/selector.gif)

						---

						### Selector
						- Element selector
						- Id selector
						- Class selector
						- Grouping selectors

						---

						### Element Selector
						- The element selector selects elements based on the element name
						- The code below selects all `<p>` elements on a page and makes them center aligned and red

						``` css
						p {
							text-align: center;
							color: red;
						}
						```

						---

						### Id Selector
						- The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element
						- The id of an element should be unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one element
						- Use a hash (`#`) followed by the id of the element

						``` css
						#slideshow {
							background: green;
							border: 1px solid red;
						}
						```

						---

						### Class Selector
						- The class selector selects elements with a specific class attribute
						- Use a period (`.`) character, followed by the name of the class

						``` css
						.center {
							text-align: center;
						}
						```

						---

						### Grouping selectors
						If you want to have multiple elements with the same styles you can group the selectors with commas, like this:

						``` css
						h1, .center-red, p {
							text-align: center;
							color: red;
						}
						```

						---

						### Descendent selector
						- Descendent selectors (or descendent combinator) allow you to combine two or more selectors so you can be more specific
						- Elements matched by the second selector are selected if they have an ancestor element matching the first selector
						- This relationship is created with a space between selectors

						``` css
						ul li {
							margin: 10px;
						}
						```

						---

						### How is CSS applied?
						There are a few rules that determine how styles are applied to your HTML. They all work together, and can combine in interesting and unexpected ways.

						---

						### Cascading
						Styles are read stop to bottom in the stylesheet, so the lowest style will "win."

						``` css
						p {
							color: red;
							font-weight: bold;
							font-size: 18px;
						}

						p {
							color: blue;
						}
						```

						``` html
						<p>I’m blue, 18px, and bold.</p>
						```

						---

						### Inheritance
						Some styles are passed from parents to children

						``` css
						p {
							color: red;
							font-weight: bold;
							font-size: 18px;
						}

						span {
							font-style: italic;
						}
						```

						``` html
						<p>
							I’m red, 18px, and bold.
							<span>I am those and also italic.</span>
						</p>
						```

						---

						### Specificity
						How a style is specified makes a difference. Some ways are "stronger" than others.
						1. `!important` — strongest
						1. Inline CSS
						1. ID
						1. Class
						1. Elements (& pseudo-elements)
						1. Universal selector (`*`) — weakest

						---

						### Specificity
						If two CSS selectors apply to the same element, the one with higher specificity wins. Under the hood, [there is a point system](https://medium.com/@frontendium/css-the-cascade-specificity-7f4ad354e58c).

						![alt text](img/css-specificity-8-728.jpg)

						---

						``` css
						.better {
							background-color: gray;
							border: none !important;
						}

						p {
							background-color: blue;
							color: white;
							padding: 5px;
							border: solid 1px white;
						}
						```
						``` html
						<p class="better">Gray background, no border.</p>
						```

						---

						### Exercise
						- Add unique ids to your about me, projects, resume, and contact sections of your `index.html`
						- Add a shared class to your each of your project divs

						<!-- .slide: class="style-exercise" -->

						---

						### CSS Comments
						- Comments allow you to enter helpful notes and hints that will not be interpreted by the browser.
						- A CSS comment starts with `/*` and ends with `*/`
						- Comments can also span multiple lines

						``` css
						p {
							color: red;
							/* This is a single comment */
							text-align: center;
						}

						/* This is
						a multi-line
						comment */

						```

						---

						### Exercise
						- Go to https://coolors.co
						- Pick a color palette that you like
						- Using comments, record the colors you picked at the top of your `style.css` file like so:

						``` css
						/*
						Colors used:
						Primary Color: #hexvalue;
						Secondary Color: #hexvalue;
						Text Color: #hexvalue;
						Backgroud Color: #hexvalue;
						*/
						```
						<!-- .slide: class="style-exercise" -->

						---

						### CSS properties

						---

						### color

						- The color property is used to set the color of the text
						- Colors in CSS can be specified using:
							- a [color name](https://www.crockford.com/colors.html) - `red`
							- a [HEX value](https://www.color-hex.com/) - `#ff0000`
							- an RGB or RGBA value - `rgb(255,0,0)`

						``` css
						p { color: white;}
						```

						---

						### background-color

						- The `background-color` property changes the color of the background
						``` css
						p {
							background-color: black;
							background-color: #000000;
							background-color: rgb(0,0,0);
						}
						```

						---

						### font-family

						- The `font-family` property assigns a font to the specified element(s)

						``` css
						body {
							/* A font family name and a generic family name */
							font-family: "Arial", sans-serif;
							font-family: "Times New Roman", serif;

							/* A generic family name */
							font-family: serif;
						}
						```

						---

						### font-size

						- `font-size` sets the size of the font

						``` css
						p {
							/* <length> values */
							font-size: 12px;
							font-size: 0.8em;

							/* <percentage> values */
							font-size: 80%;
						}
						```

						---

						### font

						- The `font` property is shorthand for `font-style`, `font-variant`, `font-weight`, `font-size`, `line-height`, and `font-family`.
						- "shorthand" properties allow you to set multiple values with just one declaration

						``` css
						p {
							font: italic bold 1.2em "Arial", sans-serif;
						}
						```

						``` css
						p {
							font-style: italic;
							font-weight: bold;
							font-size: 1.2em;
							font-family: "Arial", sans-serif;
						}
						```

						---

						### text-align

						- The `text-align` property is used to set the horizontal alignment of a text
						- Text can be left or right aligned, centered, or justified

						``` css
						h1 {
							text-align: center;
						}

						p {
							text-align: left;
						}

						.right {
							text-align: right;
						}
						```

						---

						### List of all CSS properties

						https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference

						---

						### Exercise

						- Choose a web-safe font to use on your page
							- https://www.w3schools.com/csSref/css_websafe_fonts.asp
						- Change the font color and/or background color to various elements on your page
						- Try using `font`, `font-family`, `font-size` and `text-align` on your page

						<!-- .slide: class="style-exercise" -->

						---

						### Pseudo-classes
						Some elements can be targeted with special "pseudo" classes that often deal with a temporary state of being. Links are one example we'll explore.

						---

						### Link styles

						- The four links states are:
							- `a:link` - a normal, unvisited link
							- `a:visited` - a link the user has visited
							- `a:hover` - a link when the user mouses over it
							- `a:active` - a link the moment it is clicked
						- Each state is known as a pseudo-class

						---

						### Exercise

						- Using your color palette
							- Set a color to your default link styles
							- Set another color of your link’s hover state
						- Apply a hover state to your projects so that your captions appears on hover

						<!-- .slide: class="style-exercise" -->

						---

						### Box model

						---

						### Box model

						- Padding - white space within the element’s borders
						- Margin - spacing around the element’s borders
						- Demo: http://guyroutledge.github.io/box-model/

						![alt text](img/box-model.png)

						---

						### Padding

						``` css
						div {
							padding-top: 50px;
							padding-right: 30px;
							padding-bottom: 50px;
							padding-left: 80px;
						}

						div {
							padding: 50px 30px 50px 80px;
						}
						```

						---

						### Padding

						![alt text](img/padding.png)

						---

						### Margin

						``` css
						div {
							margin-top: 100px;
							margin-right: 100px;
							margin-bottom: 150px;
							margin-left: 80px;
						}

						div {
							margin: 100px 150px 100px 80px;
						}
						```

						---

						### Margin

						![alt text](img/margin.png)

						---

						### Margin

						- You can also set margin to auto to horizontally center an element within its container

						``` css
						div {
							width: 300px;
							margin: auto;
							border: 1px solid red;
						}
						```
						<div style="width: 300px; margin: 0 auto; border: solid 1px red;">This will be automatically centered</div>

						---

						### Borders

						- The `border` property allow you to specify the style, width, and color of an element's border

						``` css
						p {
							border-width: 5px;
							border-style: solid;
							border-color: red;
						}

						p {
							border: 5px solid red;
						}
						```

						<p style="border: solid 5px red;">This property is a shorthand property for border-style, border-width, and border-color</p>


						---

						### Exercise

						- Try adding the following properties to your project divs
							- Padding
							- Margin
							- Border

						<!-- .slide: class="style-exercise" -->

						### Display

						---

						### Display

						- The `display` property specifies if/how an element is displayed
						- Every HTML element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is
						- The default display value for most elements is block or inline

						---

						A quick review...

						---

						### Block

						- A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available
						- Examples of block-level elements:
							- `<div>`
							- `<h1> - <h6>`
							- `<p>`
							- `<form>`
							- `<header>`
							- `<footer>`
							- `<section>`

						---

						### Inline

						- An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary
						- Examples of inline elements:
							- `<span>`
							- `<a>`
							- `<img>`

						---

						### Display

						- You can overwrite the default display value by using the `display` property

						``` css
						li {
							display: inline
						}

						span {
							display: block
						}
						```

						---

						### display: none

						- Setting `display:none` hides an element so it’s not viewable on the page

						``` css
						.hidden {
							display: none;
						}
						```

						---

						### inline-block

						- Similar to inline but it allows to set a width and height on the element
						- The top and bottom margins/paddings are respected

						![alt text](img/inline-block.png)

						---

						### Other display values
						Display has many other supported values in modern browsers, but aside from `flex`, which we'll discuss later, block, inline, inline-block, and none, are the main ones.

						---

						### Exercise

						- Create a new unordered list with 4 list elements
							- About Me
							- Projects
							- Resume
							- Contact
						- Make the navigation line items appear horizontally by using `display: inline-block`

						<!-- .slide: class="style-exercise" -->

						---

						### CSS Positioning

						---

						### Position

						- The `position` property specifies the positioning method for an element
						- Elements are positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties
						- There are 4 different position values:
							- Static
							- Relative
							- Absolute
							- Fixed

						---

						### Static Position

						- The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document
						- The top, right, bottom, left, and z-index properties have no effect
						- This is the default value

						``` css
						.static {
							position: static;
						}
						```

						---

						### Relative position

						- The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document
						- Setting top, right, bottom, and left properties will then cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position


						``` css
						.relative {
							position: relative;
							left: 30px;
						}
						```

						---

						### Absolute position

						- The element is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor
						- If an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestor, it uses the document body
						- Setting top, right, bottom, and left properties will then cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position

						``` css
						.absolute {
							position: absolute;
							top: 80px;
							right: 0px;
						}
						```

						---

						### Fixed position

						- The element is positioned relative to the viewport
						- It stays in the same place even when the page is scrolled
						- Setting top, right, bottom, and left properties will then cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position

						``` css
						.fixed {
							position: fixed;
							bottom: 0;
							right: 0;
						}
						```

						---

						### Demo: CSS Positioning

						https://codepen.io/matt-harris/pen/sgkFo

						---

						### Exercise

						- Inside each of your project divs
							- Create a paragraph element with some text describing the project
							- Position the paragraph so that it is absolutely positioned over the image

						<!-- .slide: class="style-exercise" -->

						---

						### CSS layout features
						In addition to being able to position individual elements in the "flow" of the page, there are also a few other layout features in modern CSS.

						- Float
						- Flex or "flexbox"
						- CSS grid

						---

						### Float

						- The `float` property is used to allow other content to flow around an element. Think of a big letter at the beginning of a book chapter
						- It can have the following values:
							- left
							- right
							- none
							- inherit

						---

						### Float

						``` css
						.right {
							float: right;
						}

						.left {
							float: left;
						}
						```

						![alt text](img/float.png)

						---

						### Float - Clear

						- The `clear` property sets whether an element must be moved below the floating elements that precede it

						``` css
						.footer {
							clear: both;
						}

						.left {
							float: left;
						}
						```

						![alt text](img/clear.png)

						---

						### Exercise

						- Make projects float so there’s 4 projects in one row

						![alt text](img/float-exercise.png)

						<!-- .slide: class="style-exercise" -->

						---

						### Flex
						Setting `display: flex;` will create a container whose children can be "flexed".
						``` css
						div {
							display: flex;
							align-items: stretch;
							justify-content: space-around;
						}
						.flexed {
							width: 20%;
							background-color: #bf79db;
						}
						```
						``` html
						<div>
							<p class="flexed"></p>
							<p class="flexed"></p>
							<p class="flexed"></p>
							<p class="flexed"></p>
						</div>
						```

						---

						<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; align-items: stretch; flex-wrap: wrap;">
							<div style="background: #bf79db; width: 20%;">&nbsp;</div>
							<div style="background: #bf79db; width: 20%;">&nbsp;</div>
							<div style="background: #bf79db; width: 20%;">&nbsp;</div>
							<div style="background: #bf79db; width: 20%;">&nbsp;</div>
						</div>

						We won't use this today, but you can [read more](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) about this newer, powerful layout feature of CSS.

						---

						### CSS Grid
						Grid is a newer layout feature that doesn't work in all older browsers. It's similar to tables but much easier to use and with more flexible options. [Learn more here](https://dev.to/karaluton/introduction-to-css-grid-what-you-should-know-52np).
